# SimpleCalculator

*Made by Sean Julag-ay*

An attempt at creating a calculator without using the eval() method, using manual parsing and tokenization/lexing instead.

I could have used eval, but I felt that manually doing it would help improve my skills as a future computer scientist.

This is my first JS project. Used this to learn about DOM and a lot of JS functions.

This was also made before I learned about regex. Probably would have made my code much less complicated haha.
